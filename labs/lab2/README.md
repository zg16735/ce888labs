## Histogram and Scaterplot

1. Read the data for the vehicles found in the file `vehicles.csv`
2. Create histograms and scatterplots for "current fleet" and "proposed fleet" - see `salaries.py` on how to do this

![histogram](./current histogram.png?raw=true)
![histogram](./new histogram.png?raw=true)
![scaterplot](./scaterplot.png?raw=true)

## Standard deviation comparison via the boostrap

- [ ] Find the standard deviation of both samples

Standard deviation of current fleet: 4.170343
Standard deviation of new fleet: 6.068931
Therefore, current fleet is better.

Use the example code for the bootstrap provided in ``bootstrap.py'' to do the following
- [ ] Find the upper and lower bound of the standard deviation of the current fleet
- [ ] Do the same with the new fleet

The upper bound of the standard deviation of the current fleet is 4.8462 and the lower bound of the standard deviation of the current fleet is 3.3752.
The upper bound of the standard deviation of the new fleet is 5.1418 and the lower bound of the standard deviation of the new fleet is 6.9057.
